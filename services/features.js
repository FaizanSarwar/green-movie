    synopsis:
      "A documentary short film exploring the power of the slow clothes\nmovement while introducing key concepts of Gandhi’s peaceful yet\npowerful Khadi movement which ultimately liberated India from British\nrule. \n\nThis film features Vancouver based slow clothes artisans and their\nreasons for creating clothes in a more mindful way. Featuring a first\nnations weaver from the Musqueam Nation resurrecting the extinct\npractice of her elders, the founders of Maiwa Handprints and the\nissues of skill preservation globally and obstacles they have\nencountered, and others. While examining the slow clothes production\nprocess this film examines Ghandi's key concepts from his powerful\nKhadi movement which are as vital today facing climate change as they\nwere in liberating India from British rule in 1947. \n",

      'Water is essential for food security and livelihood, especially for\nthe millions of rural poor who rely on agriculture. Aghbalou combines\na local story of struggle with a global call to action against the\ngrowing challenge of sustaining water supplies in the face of an\nincreasingly hostile climate. Half of Morocco’s population is\nemployed in agriculture and therefore dependent upon groundwater for\nboth food and employment. The Todgha Valley in Southern Morocco is one\nof the driest habitats on earth. Yet, residents have successfully\nsustained their livelihoods and agriculture for centuries through an\nancient system of underground channels. But today these age-old\ncommunities face new threats and challenges from groundwater\nover-extraction, population growth, and climate change, among others.\nThe film also shows how new technologies can present unintended\nproblems for the rural poor. When motorized water pumps were\nintroduced to the region, they provided more water, but affected the\nbalance of aquifers and eventually water wasn’t as easy to reach as\nit once had been, plus the cost was too high for poorer farmers.\nFeaturing local farmers from the Todgha Valley and international\nexperts, Aghbalou presents potential strategies to adapt to growing\nwater scarcity and insure a secure future for the rural poor.',

First it was\nchinook and coho, then pink and chum salmon. By the early 1990's even\nthe prized Fraser River sockeye populations began to decline.  After\nthree years (2007-2009) of consecutive closures of all fishing, the\nCanadian Government struck an inquiry led by former Justice Bruce\nCohen. The inquiry held hearings from September 2010 to December 2011\nover 139 days of testimony and called 179 witnesses. This collection\nof almost raw footage is presented here is 119 days of the testimony.\nIt was shot and funded by independent filmmaker, Scott Renyard. The\nterms of reference for the inquiry was that only one camera be allowed\nin the courtroom at a time. The footage is not fine edited and there\nare many camera swings as he captured as much of the testimony as\npossible.  This footage is here because it is an important piece of\nBritish Columbia history and is now available on this channel for the\ngeneral public, researchers, scientists and students.",

In 2005 Sami reindeer herders made an alliance\nwith Greenpeace and established a Forest Rescue Station in the\nwilderness of Inari. The international pressure from Greenpeace made\nFinnish forest company Stora Enso stop buying the wood from conflict\nareas. Kalevi Paadar, a Sami reindeer herder, lodged a complaint to\nthe UN Human Rights Commission. He claimed that logging in his home\nvillage violated their right to continue their traditional way of\nreindeer herding based on free grazing. The UN asked Finland to stop\nlogging. Yet, in 2007 Metsähallitus started logging again, this time\nin the wilderness of Kessi.',

    synopsis:
      'What happens to nature after a nuclear accident? And how does wildlife\ndeal with the world it inherits after human inhabitants have fled? In\n1986 a nuclear meltdown at the infamous Chernobyl power plant in\npresent-day Ukraine left miles of land in radioactive ruins. Residents\nliving in areas most contaminated by the disaster were evacuated and\nrelocated by government order, and a no-man’s land of our own making\nwas left to its own devices. In the ensuing 25 years, forests,\nmarshes, fields and rivers reclaimed the land, reversing the effects\nof hundreds of years of human development. And surprisingly, this\nexclusion zone, or “dead zone,” has become a kind of post-nuclear\nEden, populated by beaver and bison, horses and birds, fish and\nfalcons – and ruled by wolves. Access to the zone is now permitted,\nat least on a limited basis, and scientists are monitoring the\nsurviving wildlife in the area, trying to learn how the various\nspecies are coping with the invisible blight of radiation. As the top\npredators in this new wilderness, wolves best reflect the condition of\nthe entire ecosystem because if the wolves are doing well, the\npopulations of their prey must also be doing well. Accordingly, a key\nlong-term study of the wolves has been initiated to determine their\nhealth, their range, and their numbers. Radioactive Wolves examines\nthe state of wildlife populations in Chernobyl’s exclusion zone, an\narea that, to this day, remains too radioactive for human habitation.',

      'Climate protection begins in the rainforest. This is not a new\ninsight, but hardly anywhere has it been truly grasped. The\nrainforests in West and Central Africa are considered the lungs of the\nworld. According to WWF estimates, around 30 % of this will have\ndisappeared by 2030, and only small tropical forest areas are likely\nto remain in 50 years’ time. These are dramatic numbers in view of\nthe increasing awareness of the importance of climate protection for\nthe preservation of the planet. The struggle for climate and species\nprotection seems to be getting forgotten, almost unnoticed by the\nworld. In some ways, Gabon is an exception. Here, the state-imposed\nvision for a “Green Gabon” is an attempt at saving the rainforest\nfor future generations, perhaps also with the ulterior motive of\ngetting even richer through emissions trading. After all, Gabon is the\nthird richest country in Africa.',

Amara Farm succeeds because it's a\nmarriage: Love and dedication to the land, and a strong commitment to\ngrowing food make it possible to keep going even when the finances\ndon't add up. Like a marriage, it's the relationship that counts, and\nfarmer Arzeena Hamir has support from her husband, her children, her\nin-laws, and a co-op of like-minded farmers. These relationships help\nher achieve what money alone can't buy: A successful organic farm.",

Their big promise to their customers – designer\nclothes for the lowest prices – and the high turnover of their\ncollections continually tempt us to buy new clothes. However, if a\npiece of clothing is then quickly sorted out or comes apart, is it\nreally as cheap as it seems if we take its short life span into\naccount? Goods that are thrown away are mostly purely plastic waste.\nAnd these chains’ products are only such good value because they are\nproduced on the other side of the world in dubious conditions. In this\nprogramme, Austria fashion blogger Jean-Claude takes a closer look at\nthe impact of fast fashion on the domestic market and shows just how\nexpensive these kinds of clothes really are.',

Can an elephant who has only known a life of captivity survive\nin the forest?

    synopsis:
      'June 1977, a baby Orca was spotted swimming erratically near Nanaimo,\nBritish Columbia. It was in distress, vocalizing and swimming\nerratically. Two weeks later, Bill Davis, a sport fisherman discovered\nthe baby Orca in Menzies Bay near Campbell River. Davis befriended the\nlittle whale and began to feed her by hand in the wild. Bill’s phone\ncall to Murray Newman at the Vancouver Aquarium triggered a series of\nphone calls which ended at the office of “Sealand of the Pacific”\nand its owner, Bob Wright. Bob Wright mobilized a rescue team just in\ncase the story was true. And it was. This story captured the attention\nof thousands of people who came out to see a baby whale recover from\ngun shot wounds and terrible infections. She survived only to die\nmysteriously under a cloud of controversy 5 years later.  ',

    synopsis:
      '_Wilder than Wild: Fire, Forests, and the Future_ reveals how fire\nsuppression and climate change have exposed our forests and\nwildland-urban landscapes to large, high severity wildfires, while\ngreenhouse gases released from these fires contribute to global\nwarming. In this one-hour documentary, filmmaker Kevin White takes us\non a journey from the Rim Fire of 2013 to the wine country wildfires\nof 2017 and beyond. Along the way, we learn how the proactive use of\nprescribed fire can reduce reliance on reactive fire suppression, we\nsee a California tribe renew their tradition of cultural fire, and we\nmeet stakeholder groups working with scientists and resource managers\nto build consensus on how to restore and manage the lands we love and\ndepend on.',
