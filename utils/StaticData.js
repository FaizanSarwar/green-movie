      "Australia's Tasmania is one of the most pristine places on Earth yet\nits rainforests are under constant attack. This film is a sad\nreflection on the greed, the corruption and the destruction of\nTasmania's beautiful wilderness. It shows how wildlife is being\ndecimated, people are being poisoned and farmers are driven from their\nland. It reveals the impact these practices have on climate change and\nthe very lives of everyone else on Earth.  ",

    synopsis:
      'Water is essential for food security and livelihood, especially for\nthe millions of rural poor who rely on agriculture. Aghbalou combines\na local story of struggle with a global call to action against the\ngrowing challenge of sustaining water supplies in the face of an\nincreasingly hostile climate. Half of Morocco’s population is\nemployed in agriculture and therefore dependent upon groundwater for\nboth food and employment. The Todgha Valley in Southern Morocco is one\nof the driest habitats on earth. Yet, residents have successfully\nsustained their livelihoods and agriculture for centuries through an\nancient system of underground channels. But today these age-old\ncommunities face new threats and challenges from groundwater\nover-extraction, population growth, and climate change, among others.\nThe film also shows how new technologies can present unintended\nproblems for the rural poor. When motorized water pumps were\nintroduced to the region, they provided more water, but affected the\nbalance of aquifers and eventually water wasn’t as easy to reach as\nit once had been, plus the cost was too high for poorer farmers.\nFeaturing local farmers from the Todgha Valley and international\nexperts, Aghbalou presents potential strategies to adapt to growing\nwater scarcity and insure a secure future for the rural poor.',
